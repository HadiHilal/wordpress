 Itâ€™s one thing when a site is bypassed, and search engine robots report on several dozens of errors, but what if this number increases by hundreds or even thousands? A prompt intervention and solution should be initiated if the number of 404 errors exceed 10% of the total number of pages on the website. There can be many reasons for the appearance of such a larger number of non-existent pages, but mostly they are related to problems with the code (for instance, these pages were created with the help of scripts and styles, and the styles are in the code of the template, and not in a separate file).
Another reason why robots bypass pages tn such links.
